#ABSTRACT
Non-native ornamental plants are abundant in urban areas however, these plant taxa support lower abundance of arthropod food that is essential to birds for reproduction and survival. Demographic vital rates of urban birds suggest these populations may be experiencing food limitations, however few studies have explicitly tested mechanisms affecting habitat quality that may ultimately limit food availability.  In this study, we studied reproduction and apparent annual survival of Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) in the Washington D.C. area to test the hypothesis that bottom-up effects via non-native plants may be driving vital rates in an urban-dwelling insectivorous bird. From 2013-2016, we monitored nest boxes in >190 yards to determine the effect of non-native plants on fecundity. We also used a 16-year dataset of mark-recapture data to determine the influence of non-native plants on chickadee survival. Non-native plants had a negative impact on chickadee productivity by reducing the likelihood to breed and the number of eggs laid. There was no effect of non-native plants on nest survival however non-native shrubs increased the probability of house wrens, a species that aggressively competes for cavities. We also did not find a strong effect of non-native plants on adult chickadee survival. These results suggest that non-native plants may have the strongest impact on populations during the breeding season, when arthropod-based food requirements are highest.  Variation in annual survival may be mitigated by novel anthropogenic subsidies such as bird feeders for birds that can exhibit flexibility in winter diet. Future research should determine the tradeoff between plant-based and animal-based food during the winter for generalist consumers. We suggest that land managers interested in improving habitat for breeding birds should prioritize restoration of native plant communities in managed landscapes.
	
#INTRODUCTION
Urbanization drives significant changes to the quality of habitat that may ultimately limit wildlife populations. Bird communities that occupy urban environments are characterized by a decrease in specialist, insectivore species, and increases in generalist, omnivores (XX). Current research suggest that birds that avoid urban areas may do so because they experience poor reproduction or survival in these systems (Rodewald 2013, Evans 2015, Marzluff 2015). However, there remains a dearth of information on the demographic parameters that shape avian persistence in urban areas (Chace and Walsh 2006) and very few studies have tested specific urban-associated mechanisms of demographic consequences (Marzluff 2016). As urban areas are increasing XX-fold by 2050, it is more imperative than ever to determine which features of urbanization contribute to consequences in reproduction and survival in order to provide data-driven restoration efforts. 

The few studies that have explored the effect of urbanization on reproductive success have focused primarily on top-down impacts, especially in terms changes in predator abundance (Gering and Blair 1999, Borgmann and Rodewald 2004, Newhouse et al. 2008, Ryder et al. 2010, Balogh et al. 2011). However, patterns in nest success and adult survival is not consistent across studies, in part because bottom-up factors such as food limitation may be ultimately driving population declines (Chamberlain et al. 2009). For example, although higher numbers of predators could play a role in seasonal reproductive success, nest predation pressure is not necessarily higher in urban areas (Rodewald et al. 2010) suggesting alternative mechanisms may be at work.

Food limitation can affect both the reproduction and survival of individuals across the annual cycle. In reproduction, food limitation can affect egg quality, brooding time, and nestling survival (Martin 1987). For example, smaller clutch sizes may be a plastic adaptation to maximize fitness when resources are low (Lack 1948) or maladaptive if lower quality habitat is settled by young dispersing from other areas (Dhondt et al. 1990). Survival can also be effected, either via winter food availability, or by increasing the costs of reproduction for adults or fledged juveniles (Martin 1987). As expected, differences in life history traits, like clutch size and breeding date, are correlated with differences in food availability between habitats that differ in plant quality (Blondel et al. 1991), and habitats that are more food-rich lay more eggs earlier, and fledge more young (Blondel et al. 2006).

The demographic patterns of birds in urban areas closely resemble the effects of food limitation on fitness metrics. The most consistent pattern is that urban birds have lower success as a result of smaller clutch sizes, smaller nestling weights and fewer young produced per nesting attempt (Chamberlain et al. 2009). Apparent annual survival appears to be lower in urban areas for some species, but similar for others (XX). This variation may depend on the life history of the species, where generalist species experience higher survival because of the availability of anthropogenic-derived food (Evans et al. 2015).

Determining the role of bottom-up processes in urban demographics has been largely ignored, despite that floristic diversity is significantly altered in residential landscapes. Widespread changes in plant quality can occur due to the landscaping decisions of private homeowners; the most obvious is the shift from native plant vegetation, to communities dominated by non-native ornamental species. Non-native plants reduce the diversity (XX), abundance, (XX) and biomass of invertebrate communities that are essential for reproduction (XX). In addition, areas dominated with non-native plants appear to have lower diversity of birds occupying those areas (Burghardt et al. 2009, etc.). However, for the species, that remain, much less is known whether novel, non-native plant communities impact individual fitness. 
	 
	 Although programs to promote 'wildlife-friendly' plantings have operated under the auspice of improving habitat (Marzluff and Ewing 2001), few studies have quantified how non-native vegetation affects birds at the population level. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that non-native plants influence avian vital rates by monitoring nests and yearly survival of a cavity-nesting insectivore, the Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) in private yards within the Washington D.C. area that varied in non-native plant dominance. Because non-native plants support less arthropod biomass for insectivores to produce and raise young, we predicted that chickadees occupying neighborhoods with more non-native plants would have lower reproduction and lower yearly survival.

#METHODS
##*Study Sites and Species.*
We studied reproduction and survival of Carolina chickadees (hereafter: 'chickadee') within 160 private properties of homeowners participating in the Neighborhood Nestwatch Program (Evans et al. 2005). Each 'site' was composed of a focal yard that contained a chickadee-appropriate nest box (Narango et al. 2017), as well as a 50-m radius (0.79 Ha) area around that yard. A 50-m radius was chosen because this is area is similar to the nesting territory of chickadees (Brewer 1963). All sites were located within a residential landscape and no sites were located within or adjacent to large parkland. Most sites were at least 1km away from each other (XX ± XX km SD). Sites varied primarily in the diversity and abundance of native and non-native vegetation as well as proximity to retained areas of natural vegetation and impervious surface (Evans et al 2015). 
	
Carolina chickadees, are non-migratory, synchronous breeding songbirds that are distributed across the Eastern and Southeastern United States. They are an 'edge-adapted' species that breed from March-June (Mostrom et al. 2002), and will readily occupy urban landscapes. Chickadees are an ideal model species for this study because they are cavity-nesters that will use artificial locations for nesting. The advantage of studying a cavity-nester is that 1) the majority of nest success derives from differences in clutch size and nestling survival and 2) We can control for the availability of appropriate nesting locations  and 3) because nest survival is high, we are able to test the effects of bottom-up drivers via plant quality without confounding impacts of predators. 

Chickadees are also well suited for this study because they are primarily insectivorous despite persisting in urban landscapes, (Mostrom et al. 2002) During the breeding season, invertebrates represent >90% of their diet (Martin and Zim 1951, Narango et al. unpublished data). In the non-breeding season, chickadees will switch to a diet that includes plant material, however, because invertebrates still maintain 30-50% of the diet in the fall-winter, animal-based food may have important implications for annual survival (Martin and Zim 1951, Narango et al. unpublished data). In all seasons, herbivorous lepidopteran larvae are a disproportionately important food item relative to other invertebrate taxa (Narango et al. unpublished data) and herbivorous arthropod taxa are negatively impacted by reductions in host plant availability (XXX). 

##*Reproduction.*
Nest boxes were monitored from April-June in the years 2013-2016 by primarily homeowner volunteers. Homeowners were trained in nest monitoring protocol by technicians and submitted monitoring data to the project through a web-based application over the season. Nest boxes were checked approximately once per week and presence of a nest, number of eggs and number of nestlings were recorded. Clutch and brood sizes were also confirmed by trained observers visiting the site at least once during the active nest. Following successful completion of the nest, boxes were checked once more for any deceased nestlings. If predation took place, evidence of the culprit (e.g. competitor nest material, damage to the nest) was recorded. Each nest was assigned a clutch completion date, total eggs laid, total eggs hatched, whether it was successful and total number of young produced. If a nest was not present in the nest box, the site area was searched to account for nests occurring in natural cavities or adjacent properties. 

##*Survival. *
We quantified yearly survival using a 2000-2016 dataset on color-banded chickadees (see Evans et al 2015 for additional information). Sites were visited at least once yearly between April-August in order to color-band chickadees and resight returning individuals.  Birds were captured opportunistically using mist nets and conspecific playback or capture of breeding individuals at the nest box. Individuals are marked with a unique combination of colored plastic bands, as well as a US Fish and Wildlife Service aluminum band. All birds were aged using plumage characteristics and skull ossification and sexed via breeding evidence. We also measured wing chord for body size and weighed to the nearest 0.01g.  During the visit, technicians also systematically covered a 200m radius area in order to resight previously captured individuals that were not present in the focal yard. Homeowners were also instructed to report observations of color-banded individuals throughout the year.

##*Vegetation. *
We quantified non-native plant dominance at the site level, using a modified i-Tree protocol for surveying wildlife habitat (Lerman et al. 2014). We surveyed 5 non-overlapping, 11.3m plots including one centered on the nest box and 4 additional plots located randomly within the 50-m radius area. Within each plot, we measured and identified all woody trees and shrubs and calculated the importance value for each plant species (Narango et al. 2017 for more details). We determined plant origin using USGS range maps (XX) and designated non-native plants as any taxa and has a distribution that does not include the eastern united states (i.e. east of the Mississippi river). Importance values for all non-native plants were summed to obtain total importance value of non-native species for both trees and shrubs seperately. Because plant biomass may also be important for foliage-gleaning species, we also calculated total tree basal area by summing the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all tree stems and multiplying by XXXXX (the forester's constant). We obtained total canopy volume of shrubs by using length, width and height in an equation from Thorne et al. (2002). 

##*Statistical Analysis. *
###Reproduction. 
We used life history Aster models (Geyer et al., 2007; package ASTER in R: Geyer, 2012) to determine the strength of influence non-native plants have on several conditional levels of reproductive success.  In order to limit the number of models tested with variables with minimal justification, we limited our testing to our variable of interest: non-native plants, as well as year to account for annual variation. We then compared the maximum likelihood of nested models to determine the relative effect of non-native plants at each level. Finally, we bootstrapped parameter estimates to determine the confidence interval of fledgling production across a gradient of non-native plant dominance.

###Survival models. 
To estimate survival, we used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to fit the relationships between our covariates of interest and chickadee survivorship, as well as the detection probability. Models were made using package RMark in Program R (Laake 2013). We then ranked a set of models representing competing hypotheses using AIC to select the most parsimonious model. Models in which the ??AICc was <4 were considered models with the best fit. Based on previous work in the same system by Evans et al (2015), we first constructed a priori models for chickadees that included body condition, time since marking, and whether the homeowner submitted data (participation) (see supplemental information for additional details). We compared candidate models for males and females separately. To assess the effect of non-native landscaping, we included a term that represented the importance value of non-native trees and shrubs. Because habitat improvement programs also suggest increasing overall vegetation regardless of origin, we also included basal area and shrub volume. 
	 

#RESULTS	
##*Summary.*
Between 2013 and 2016, we collected plant data from 160 different sites that were monitored for chickadee breeding activity. From those sites, we located and monitored 224 chickadee nests at 91 sites. The mean number of fledglings per nest was 3.00 ± 2.58 SD however, a large proportion of sites (39%) did not produce any fledglings because no nest was ever initiated, despite chickadees being present at the area. Between 2000-2016, 2102 chickadees were captured at Neighborhood Nestwatch yards and 969 chickadees (table 1) were captured in XX yards with associated plant data. 

##*Reproduction.* 
Our aster models revealed that reproductive success, defined as number of young fledged, declined as non-native plants increased dominance within the yard (?? -0.30±0.06, p<0.001, figure 2). At each conditional level, non-native plants had a negative effect on the probability of chickadee settlement (?? -2.97±0.63, p<0.001), the probability of nesting (?? -1.73±0.79, p=0.02), and the number of eggs laid (?? -0.49±0.23, p=0.03). There was no effect of non-native plants on nest success (?? -1.06±1.06, p>0.1); however, an increase in non-native shrubs also increased the probability of house wren yard occupancy (model-averaged ?? 0.71 ± 0.36, CI: 0.02, 1.41), which is the most frequent nest competitor in this system.

#DISCUSSION
In novel landscapes, like urban areas, the conservation value of non-native plants has been argued (Schlaepfer et al 2011), especially when non-native species appear to provide habitat and resources to wildlife. In this context however, few studies explicitly compare the habitat value provided between non-native plants and native species that were replaced. Here, we show that neighborhoods landscaped with non-native plants are poor habitat for chickadee reproduction and may negatively affect population growth. 

Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that native plants are better at providing ecosystem services (issacs at al 2008) and resources for wildlife (Narango et al.XXX, Greenberg and Walter 2010, Lerman et al 2014). Many studies re: birds and non-native plants  is in the context of  an overabundant invasive species. For example, Morrow's honeysuckle () had a negative effect on nesting success of field sparrows (McChesney and Anderson 2014) but no effect on veeries (XX). While these studies are valuable, they may not be relevant to urban ecology in  part because it is unclear whether the documented effects are because the plant was not related to the native ecosystem, or because of the phlyogenetic novelty of the specific invader and/or reduced plant diversity in the system. Our study improves on these studies because managed yards tend to be highly diverse (XX +/- XX) and differ mainly in the novelty of the plant community.  

Our results suggest that non-native plants reduce the reproductive potential of an insectivorous bird via bottom-up effects on territory quality. Although there was no effect on nest success, non-native plants also have the potential to influence top-down predation by increasing interactions with nest competitors. Non-native landscaping appears to contribute to the paucity of insectivores that occupy urban areas because these yards are unsuitable for supporting breeding and producing eggs. Homeowners prioritizing wildlife habitat should plant and retain native plants to encourage positive growth in insectivorous bird populations.

One way that birds may cope with changes in food availability is to switch to alternative food types. Degraded habitat may reduce the availability of certain trophic niches and trophic flexibility may predict the occurrence of bird species in degraded habitats (Edwards et al. 2013). Although granivorous and omnivorous birds are more likely to persist in urban areas, most of these species also require arthropods during the breeding season.

Non-native plants support fewer herbivorous insects, but may have other guilds, such as generalist predators, which could facilitate a switch in food types. However, if both guilds are impacted by plant availability (Haddad et al. 2009), birds may switch to feed on plant-based and supplementary food types which may decrease seasonal fitness (Plummer et al. 2013; but see Robb et al. 2008). Quantifying the degree to which birds use different available resources may help elucidate the drivers behind reproductive variation in urban areas.
